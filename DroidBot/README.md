## How to install

Clone this repo and install with `pip`:

```shell
cd droidbot/
pip install -e .
```

If successfully installed, you should be able to execute `droidbot -h`.

## How to use

1. Make sure you have:

    + `.apk` file path of the app you want to analyze.
    + A device or an emulator connected to your host machine via `adb`.

2. Start DroidBot:

    ```
    droidbot -a <path_to_apk> -o output_dir
    ```
    That's it! You will find much useful information, including the UTG, generated in the output dir.

    + If you are using multiple devices, you may need to use `-d <device_serial>` to specify the target device. The easiest way to determine a device's serial number is calling `adb devices`.
    + On some devices, you may need to manually turn on accessibility service for DroidBot (required by DroidBot to get current view hierarchy).
    + If you want to test a large scale of apps, you may want to add `-keep_env` option to avoid re-installing the test environment every time.
    + You can also use a json-format script to customize input for certain states. Here are some [script samples](script_samples/). Simply use `-script <path_to_script.json>` to use DroidBot with a script.
    + If your apps do not support getting views through Accessibility (e.g., most games based on Cocos2d, Unity3d), you may find `-cv` option helpful.
    + You can use `-humanoid` option to let DroidBot communicate with [Humanoid](https://github.com/yzygitzh/Humanoid) in order to generate human-like test inputs.
    + You may find other useful features in `droidbot -h`.
